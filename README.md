I used the News API for my project. My code allows the user to do two main things:
1. Click a button to get at most 20 articles/posts from live top and breaking news at the time of the search.
2. Enter a keyword, and have the app return a relevant article/post. Input that is less than 1 character will not validate.
All articles display the headline, the author, the publication date, a short description, the url, and the source publisher of the article/post.

The user is also prompted to enter their name on the main page to say hi to the app. Input with numbers or special characters will not validate. Users can also see, in different views, which keywords they've already searched, previous articles they found with searching, and the top headlines. All pages can be navigated to from the navigation section at the top of every page.
